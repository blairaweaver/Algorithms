Array
    1 index for each vertex

Boruvka
    have clusters (initially each cluster is a single vertex)
    Look at each cluster
        Look at each edge coming from that cluster that isn't connected to itself
    Do this while there is more than one cluster

create cluster object?
    keep track of vert in cluster and keep track of edges not pointing to itself?

create boolean function to determine cycle
